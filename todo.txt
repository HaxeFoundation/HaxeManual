Todo:
1.1 - What is Haxe?: Could we have a big Haxe logo in the First Manual Page (Introduction) under the menu (a bit like a book cover ?) It looks a bit empty now and is a landing page for "Manual"
2.1 - Basic Types: Check wording here (we don't want to address "you")
2.1 - Basic Types: A bit heavy on jargon. I don't know what abstract types are, what :coreType means, what metadata refers to and all the other stuff, but the section references and warnings are good to have.
2.1.3 - Numeric Operators: make sure the types are right for inc, dec, negate, and bitwise negate
2.1.3 - Numeric Operators: While introducing the different operations, we should include that information as well, including how they differ with the "C" standard, see http://haxe.org/manual/operators
2.2 - Nullability: `Null<T>` hasn't been mentioned before I think, so it could be confusing as to what it is and why it's there and how it works and why it works.
2.2.1 - Optional Arguments and Nullability:: Is there a difference between `?y : Int` and `y : Null<Int>` or can you even do the latter? Some more explanation and examples with native optional and Haxe optional arguments and how they relate to nullability would be nice.
2.3 - Class Instance: Same as in 2.2, what the `Class<T>` syntax means is unclear at this point.
2.3 - Class Instance: What are class types?
2.4 - Enum Instance: Same as in 2.2, what is `Enum<T>` syntax?
2.4 - Enum Instance: Doesn't really show enum usage, do you use Color.Red or just Red? etc.
2.4.1 - Enum Constructor: EnumValue is the type that unifies with the types that are instances of Enums? Would benefit from more elaboration.
2.4.1 - Enum Constructor: For this to work in markdown, it either needs line numbers or the paragraph needs rephrasing.
2.4.1 - Enum Constructor: `Enum<Color>` syntax, what's the difference between that and Color?
2.5.3 - Optional Fields: I don't really know how these work yet.
2.6 - Function Type: It seems a bit convoluted explanations. Should we maybe start by "decoding" the meaning of  Void -> Void, then Int -> Bool -> Float, then maybe have samples using $type
2.7.2 - Implementing Dynamic: resolve()
3.5 - Unification: Mention toString()/String conversion somewhere in this chapter.
3.5.1 - Between Class/Interface: "parent class" should probably be used here, but I have no idea what it means, so I will refrain from changing it myself.
3.7.2 - Import: Describe import a.*
3.7.3 - Resolution Order: proper label and caption + code/identifier styling for diagram
5.11.1 - Inline constructors: I would add a "inlining" section in Manual/Language Features, then move the content of  Expression/new/inline constructors there
6.4 - Pattern Matching: Check "you" wording.
6.6 - Array Comprehension: Comprehensions are only listing Arrays, not Maps
8.3.1 - Embedding resources: what to use for listing of non-haxe code like hxml?
9.5.1 - Enum building: Check if we can build GADTs this way.
10.2.1 - Array: make sure this is true about static targets
10.2.1 - Array: Maybe we should introduce \\ api{type name}
10.2.3 - List: I hope none of these are lies -C 
10.4.3 - Integer Math: I think C++ can use integer operatins, but I don't know about any other targets. Only saw this mentioned in an old discussion thread, still true?
