## 2.6 Function Type

The function type, along with the [monomorph](types-monomorph.md), is a type which is usually well-hidden from Haxe users, yet present everywhere. We can make it surface by using `$type`, a special Haxe identifier which outputs the type its expression has during compilation :

```haxe
class Main {
  static public function main() {
    // i : Int -> s : String -> Bool
    $type(test);
    $type(test(1, "foo")); // Bool
  }

  static function test(i:Int, s:String):Bool {
    return true;
  }
}
```

There is a strong resemblance between the declaration of function `test` and the output of the first `$type` expression, yet also a subtle difference:

* **Function arguments** are separated by the special arrow token `->` instead of commas, and
* the **function return type** appears at the end after another `->`.

In either notation it is obvious that the function `test` accepts a first argument of type `Int`, a second argument of type `String` and returns a value of type `Bool`. If a call to this function, such as `test(1, "foo")`, is made within the second `$type` expression, the Haxe typer checks if `1` can be assigned to `Int` and if `"foo"` can be assigned to `String`. The type of the call is then equal to the type of the value `test` returns, which is `Bool`.

If a function type has other function types as argument or return type, parentheses can be used to group them correctly. For example, `Int -> (Int -> Void) -> Void` represents a function which has a first argument of type `Int`, a second argument of function type `Int -> Void` and a return of `Void`.
