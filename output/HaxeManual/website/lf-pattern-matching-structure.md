## 6.4.4 Structure matching

It is also possible to match against the fields of anonymous structures and instances:

```haxe
    var myStructure = {
      name: "haxe",
      rating: "awesome"
    };
    var value = switch(myStructure) {
      case { name: "haxe", rating: "poor" }:
        throw false;
      case { rating: "awesome", name: n }:
        n;
      case _:
        "no awesome language found";
    }
    trace(value); // haxe
```

In the second case we bind the matched `name` field to identifier `n` if `rating` matches `"awesome"`. Of course this structure could also be put into the `Tree` from the previous example to combine structure and enum matching.
