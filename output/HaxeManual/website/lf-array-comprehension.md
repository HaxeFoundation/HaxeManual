## 6.6 Array Comprehension

Array comprehension in Haxe uses existing syntax to allow concise initialization of arrays. It is identified by `for` or `while` constructs:

```haxe
class Main {
  static public function main() {
    var a = [for (i in 0...10) i];
    trace(a); // [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

    var i = 0;
    var b = [while(i < 10) i++];
    trace(b); // [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
  }
}
```

Variable `a` is initialized to an array holding the numbers 0 to 9. The compiler generates code which adds the value of each loop iteration to the array, so the following code would be equivalent:

```haxe
var a = [];
for (i in 0...10) a.push(i);
```

Variable `b` is initialized to an array with the same values, but through a different comprehension style using `while` instead of `for`. Again, the following code would be equivalent:

```haxe
var i = 0;
var a = [];
while(i < 10) a.push(i++);
```

The loop expression can be anything, including conditions and nested loops, so the following works as expected:

```haxe
class Main {
  static public function main() {
    var a = [
      for (a in 1...11)
        for(b in 2...4)
          if (a % b == 0)
            a+ "/" +b
    ];
    // [2/2,3/3,4/2,6/2,6/3,8/2,9/3,10/2]
    trace(a);
  }
}

```
