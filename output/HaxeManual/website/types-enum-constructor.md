## 2.4.1 Enum Constructor

Similar to classes and their constructors, enums provide a way of instantiating them by using one of their constructors. However, unlike classes, enums provide multiple constructors which can easily be used through their name:

```haxe
var a = Red;
var b = Green;
var c = Rgb(255, 255, 0);
```
In this code the type of variables `a`, `b` and `c` is `Color`. Variable `c` is initialized using the `Rgb` constructor with arguments.

All enum instances can be assigned to a special type named `EnumValue`.

> ##### Define: EnumValue
>
> EnumValue is a special type which unifies with all enum instances. It is used by the Haxe Standard Library to provide certain operations for all enum instances and can be employed in user-code accordingly in cases where an API requires **an** enum instance, but not a specific one.

It is important to distinguish enum types and enum constructors, as this example demonstrates:

```haxe
enum Color {
  Red;
  Green;
  Blue;
  Rgb(r:Int, g:Int, b:Int);
}

class Main {
  static public function main() {
    var ec:EnumValue = Red; // valid
    var en:Enum<Color> = Color; // valid
    // Error: Color should be Enum<Color>
    //var x:Enum<Color> = Red;
  }
}

```

If the commented line is uncommented, the program does not compile because `Red` (an enum constructor) cannot be assigned to a variable of type `Enum<Color>` (an enum type). The relation is analogous to a class and its instance.

> ##### Trivia: Concrete type parameter for `Enum<T>`
>
> One of the reviewers of this manual was confused about the difference between `Color` and `Enum<Color>` in the example above. Indeed, using a concrete type parameter there is pointless and only serves the purpose of demonstration. Usually we would omit the type there and let [type inference](type-system-type-inference.md) deal with it.
