## 9.3.1 Expression Reification

Expression reification is used to create instances of `haxe.macro.Expr` in a convenient way. The Haxe Compiler accepts the usual Haxe syntax and translates it to an expression object. It supports several escaping mechanisms, all of which are triggered by the `$` character:

* `${}` and `$e{}`: `Expr -> Expr` This can be used to compose expressions. The expression within the delimiting `{ }` is executed, with its value being used in place.
* `$a{}`: `Array<Expr> -> Array<Expr>` or `Array<Expr> -> Expr` If used in a place where an `Array<Expr>` is expected (e.g. call arguments, block elements), `$a{}` treats its value as that array. Otherwise it generates an array declaration.
* `$b{}`: `Array<Expr> -> Expr` Generates a block expression from the given expression array.
* `$i{}`: `String -> Expr` Generates an identifier from the given string.
* `$p{}`: `Array<String> -> Expr` Generates a field expression from the given string array.
* `$v{}`: `Dynamic -> Expr` Generates an expression depending on the type of its argument. This is only guaranteed to work for [basic types](types-basic-types.md) and [enum instances](types-enum-instance.md).

Additionally the [metadata](lf-metadata.md) `@:pos(p)` can be used to map the position of the annotated expression to `p` instead of the place it is reified at.

This kind of reification only works in places where the internal structure expects an expression. This disallows `object.${fieldName}`, but `object.$fieldName` works. This is true for all places where the internal structure expects a string:

* field access `object.$name`
* variable name `var $name = 1;`

##### since Haxe 3.1.0

* field name `{ $name: 1} `
* function name `function $name() { }`
* catch variable name `try e() catch($name:Dynamic) { }`

Furthermore, a `new` expression can be reified by providing [haxe.macro.TypePath](http://api.haxe.org/haxe/macro/TypePath.html) argument: `new $typePath()`
