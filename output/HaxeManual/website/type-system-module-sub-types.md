## 3.7.1 Module Sub-Types

A module sub-type is a type declared in a module with a different name than that module. This allows a single .hx file to contain multiple types, which can be accessed unqualified from within the module, and by using `package.Module.Type` from other modules:

```haxe
var e:haxe.macro.Expr.ExprDef;
```

Here the sub-type `ExprDef` within module `haxe.macro.Expr` is accessed. 

An example sub-type declaration would look like the following :

```haxe
// a/A.hx
package a;

class A { public function new() {} }
// sub-type
class B { public function new() {} }
```

```haxe
// Main.hx
import a.A;

class Main {
    static function main() {
        var subtype1 = new a.A.B();

        // these are also valid, but require import a.A or import a.A.B :
        var subtype2 = new B();
        var subtype3 = new a.B();
    }
}
```

The sub-type relation is not reflected at run-time. That is, public sub-types become a member of their containing package, which could lead to conflicts if two modules within the same package tried to define the same sub-type. Naturally, the Haxe compiler detects these cases and reports them accordingly. In the example above `ExprDef` is generated as `haxe.macro.ExprDef`.

Sub-types can also be made private:

```haxe
private class C { ... }
private enum E { ... }
private typedef T { ... }
private abstract A { ... }
```

> ##### Define: Private type
>
> A type can be made private by using the `private` modifier. As a result, the type can only be directly accessed from within the [module](dictionary.md#define-module) it is defined in.
> 
> Private types, unlike public ones, do not become a member of their containing package.

The accessibility of types can be controlled more fine-grained by using [access control](lf-access-control.md).
