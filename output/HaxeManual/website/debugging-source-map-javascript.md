## 13.5.1 Source Maps in JavaScript

In the generated JavaScript the last line will have a reference to the source map that looks like this:

```haxe
//# sourceMappingURL=Main.js.map
```

To include the hx sources as part of the JS source map, compile with `-D source-map-content`.

Make sure to enable 'JS source maps' in the browser developer tool settings.
