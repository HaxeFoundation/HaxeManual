## 12.6.1 Getting started with Haxe/Cppia

Cppia is a scriptable cpp subtarget for Haxe. A cppia script is an instructions assembly script that can be run inside a cppia host and gives you runtime speed at near-zero compilation time. It also lets add performance critical code to the host, wich gives you full cpp runtime speed for those parts.
