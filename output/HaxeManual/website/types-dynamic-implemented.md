## 2.7.2 Implementing Dynamic

Classes can [implement](types-interfaces.md) `Dynamic` and `Dynamic<T>` which enables arbitrary field access. In the former case, fields can have any type, in the latter, they are constrained to be compatible with the parameter type:

```haxe
class ImplementsDynamic
  implements Dynamic<String> {
  public var present:Int;
  public function new() {}
}

class Main {
  static public function main() {
    var c = new ImplementsDynamic();
    // valid, present is an existing field
    c.present = 1;
    // valid, assigned value is a String
    c.stringField = "foo";
    // error, Int should be String
    //c.intField = 1;
  }
}
```

Implementing `Dynamic` does not satisfy the requirements of other implemented interfaces. The expected fields still have to be implemented explicitly.

Classes that implement `Dynamic` (with or without type parameter) can also utilize a special method named `resolve`. If a [read access](dictionary.md#define-read-access) is made and the field in question does not exist, the `resolve` method is called with the field name as argument:

```haxe
class Resolve implements Dynamic<String> {
  public var present:Int;
  public function new() {}
  function resolve(field:String) {
    return "Tried to resolve " +field;
  }
}

class Main {
  static public function main() {
    var c = new Resolve();
    c.present = 2;
    trace(c.present);
    trace(c.resolveMe);
  }
}
```
