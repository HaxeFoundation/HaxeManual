## 10.3 Regular Expressions

Haxe has built-in support for **regular expressions**. They can be used to verify the format of a string, transform a string or extract some regular data from a given text.

Haxe has special syntax for creating regular expressions. We can create a regular expression object by typing it between the `~/` combination and a single `/` character:

```haxe
var r = ~/haxe/i;
```

Alternatively, we can create regular expression with regular syntax:

```haxe
var r = new EReg("haxe", "i");
```

First argument is a string with regular expression pattern, second one is a string with **flags** (see below).

We can use standard regular expression patterns such as:

* `.` any character
* `*` repeat zero-or-more
* `+` repeat one-or-more
* `?` optional zero-or-one
* `[A-Z0-9]` character ranges
* `[^\ r\ n\ t]` character not-in-range
* `(...)` parenthesis to match groups of characters
* `^` beginning of the string (beginning of a line in multiline matching mode)
* `$` end of the string (end of a line in multiline matching mode)
* `|` "OR" statement.

For example, the following regular expression matches valid email addresses:
```haxe
~/[A-Z0-9._%-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+.[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]?/i;
```

Please notice that the `i` at the end of the regular expression is a **flag** that enables case-insensitive matching.

The possible flags are the following:

* `i` case insensitive matching
* `g` global replace or split, see below
* `m` multiline matching, `^` and `$` represent the beginning and end of a line
* `s` the dot `.` will also match newlines **(Neko, C++, PHP, Flash and Java targets only)**
* `u` use UTF-8 matching **(Neko and C++ targets only)**
