## 1.4 History

The Haxe project was started on 22 October 2005 by French developer **Nicolas Cannasse** as a successor to the popular open-source ActionScript 2 compiler **MTASC** (Motion-Twin Action Script Compiler) and the in-house **MTypes** language, which experimented with the application of type inference to an object oriented language. Nicolas' long-time passion for programming language design and the rise of new opportunities to mix different technologies as part of his game developer work at **Motion-Twin** led to the creation of a whole new language.

Being spelled **haXe** back then, its beta version was released in February 2006 with the first supported targets being AVM-bytecode and Nicolas' own **Neko** virtual machine.

Nicolas Cannasse, who remains leader of the Haxe project to this date, kept on designing Haxe with a clear vision, subsequently leading to the Haxe 1.0 release in May 2006. This first major release came with support for JavaScript code generation and already had some of the features that define Haxe today such as type inference and structural sub-typing.

Haxe 1 saw several minor releases over the course of two years, adding the Flash AVM2 target along with the **haxelib**-tool in August 2006 and the ActionScript 3 target in March 2007. During these months, there was a strong focus on improving stability, which resulted in several minor bug-fix releases.

Haxe 2.0 was released in July 2008, including the PHP target, courtesy of **Franco Ponticelli**. A similar effort by **Hugh Sanderson** lead to the addition of the C++ target in July 2009 with the Haxe 2.04 release.

Just as with Haxe 1, what followed were several months of stability releases. In January 2011, Haxe 2.07 was released with the support of **macros**. Around that time, **Bruno Garcia** joined the team as maintainer of the JavaScript target, which saw vast improvements in the subsequent 2.08 and 2.09 releases.

After the release of 2.09, **Simon Krajewski** joined the team and work towards Haxe 3 began. Furthermore, **CauÃª Waneck**'s Java and C# targets found their way into the Haxe builds. It was then decided to make one final Haxe 2 release, which happened in July 2012 with the release of Haxe 2.10.

In late 2012, the Haxe 3 switch was flipped and the Haxe Compiler team, now backed by the newly established **Haxe Foundation**, focused on this next major version. Haxe 3 was subsequently released in May 2013.
