## 3.6 Type Inference

The effects of type inference have been seen throughout this document and will continue to be important. A simple example shows type inference at work:

```haxe
class Main {
  public static function main() {
    var x = null;
    $type(x); // Unknown<0>
    x = "foo";
    $type(x); // String
  }
}
```
The special construct `$type` was previously mentioned in order to simplify the explanation of the [Function Type](types-function.md) type, so let us now introduce it officially:

> ##### Define: `$type`
>
> `$type` is a compile-time mechanism being called like a function, with a single argument. The compiler evaluates the argument expression and then outputs the type of that expression.

In the example above, the first `$type` prints `Unknown<0>`. This is a [monomorph](types-monomorph.md), a type that is not yet known. The next line `x = "foo"` assigns a `String` literal to `x`, which causes the [unification](type-system-unification.md) of the monomorph with `String`. We then see that the type of `x` indeed has changed to `String`.

Whenever a type other than [Dynamic](types-dynamic.md) is unified with a monomorph, that monomorph **becomes** that type: it **morphs** into that type. Therefore it cannot morph into a different type afterwards, a property expressed in the **mono** part of its name.

Following the rules of unification, type inference can occur in compound types:

```haxe
class Main {
  public static function main() {
    var x = [];
    $type(x); // Array<Unknown<0>>
    x.push("foo");
    $type(x); // Array<String>
  }
}
```
Variable `x` is first initialized to an empty `Array`. At this point we can tell that the type of `x` is an array, but we do not yet know the type of the array elements. Consequentially, the type of `x` is `Array<Unknown<0>>`. It is only after pushing a `String` onto the array that we know the type to be `Array<String>`.
