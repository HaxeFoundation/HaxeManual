## 5.5 Array Declaration

Arrays are initialized by enclosing comma `,` separated values in brackets `[]`. A plain `[]` represents the empty array, whereas `[1, 2, 3]` initializes an array with three elements `1`, `2` and `3`.

The generated code may be less concise on platforms that do not support array initialization. Essentially, such initialization code then looks like this:

```
var a = new Array();
a.push(1);
a.push(2);
a.push(3);
```
This should be considered when deciding if a function should be inlined ([Inline](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/4.4.2-Inline.md)) as it may inline more code than visible in the syntax.

Advanced initialization techniques are described in [Array Comprehension](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/7.5-Array_Comprehension.md).
