## 5.6 Object Declaration

> Anonymous Objects are synonymous with Anonymous Structures?  Objects are the same as structures?
Object declaration begins with an opening curly brace `{` after which `key:value`-pairs separated by comma `,` follow, and which ends in a closing curly brace `}`.

```haxe
{
	key1:value1,
	key2:value2,
	...
	keyN:valueN
}
```
Further details of object declaration are described in the section about [anonymous structures](2.5-Anonymous_Structure.md).
