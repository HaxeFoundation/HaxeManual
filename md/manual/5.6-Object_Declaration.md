## 5.6 Object Declaration

Object declaration begins with an opening curly brace `{` after which `key:value`-pairs separated by comma `,` follow, and which ends in a closing curly brace `}`.

```
{
	key1:value1,
	key2:value2,
	...
	keyN:valueN
}
```
Further details of object declaration are described in the section about anonymous structures ([Anonymous Structure](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/2.5-Anonymous_Structure.md)).
