## 5.16 switch

>TODO: I pulled a lot of this from the Haxe 2 manual, but I see that it has changed in Haxe 3. So it basically needs reworked, and needs to  better integrate with the Pattern Matching section later on.



A **switch** statement is an alternative to multiple **if ... else** blocks.```haxe
// Conditional based on if...else if statements
if( v == 0 )
  e1;
else if( v == foo(1) )
  e2;
else if( v == 65 || v == 90 )
  e3;
else
  e4;


// Same conditional check using switch
switch( v ) {
  case 0:
    e1;
  case foo(1):
    e2;
  case 65, 90:
    e3;
  default:
    e4;
}

```

Switches in Haxe behave differently than traditional C-style switches.  All **cases** are separate expressions; after one **case** is executed, the switch block is automatically exited.  Consequently, **break** statements are not used in switch blocks, the position of the **default** case is not important, and there is no case **fall through**.

On some platforms, switches on constant values (especially integers) might be optomized for speed 
>TODO: Still true in Haxe 3?  If so, which platforms?



Switching on an [enum instance](2.4-Enum_Instance.md) produces special behavior.  If no **default** case is specified, the compiler checks that all of the enum's constructors are covered.  If constructors are missing, the compiler will generate a warning.

```haxe
enum Color{
  Red;
  Green;
  Blue;
}

var myColor : Color

//...

switch( myColor ){
  case Red: 0xFF0000;
  case Green: 0x00ff00;
}
//will cause a compile warning because 'Blue' is missing

```
