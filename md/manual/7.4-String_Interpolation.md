## 7.4 String Interpolation

With **String Interpolation**, it is no longer necessary to concatenate values into a string. In a String enlosed by single-quotes, Variables preceeded by a dollar sign ( $ ) are replaced by their value (**expanded** in PHP lingo).  

```haxe
var x = 12;
// Concatenating Approach
trace('The value of x is ' + x);

// With String Interpolation;
trace('The value of x is $x'); // The value of x is 12


```

Furthermore, it is possible to include whole expressions in the string by using `${expr}`, with `expr` being any valid haxe expression:

```haxe
var x = 12;
trace('The sum of $x and 3 is ${x + 3}'); // The sum of x and 3 is 15
``` 
String interpolation is a compile-time feature and has no impact on runtime. The above example is equivalent to manual concatenation, which is exactly what the compiler generates:

```haxe
trace("The sum of " +x+ " and 3 is " + (x + 3));
```
Of course the use of single-quote enclosed strings without any interpolation remains valid, but care has to be taken regarding the $ character as it triggers interpolation. If an actual dollar-sign should be used in the string, `$$`

 can be used.

> ##### Trivia: String Interpolation before haxe 3
>
> String Interpolation has been a haxe feature since version 2.09. Back then, the macro `Std.format` had to be used, being both slower and less comfortable than the new string interpolation syntax.
