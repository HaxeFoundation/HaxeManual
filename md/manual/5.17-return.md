## 5.17 return

A `return` expression can come with or without a value expression:

```haxe
return;
return expression;
```

**return** leaves the control-flow of the innermost function it is declared in, which has to be distinguished when [closures](5.9-Closure.md) are involved:

```haxe
function f1() {
	function f2() {
		return;
	}
	f2();
	expression;
}
```

The `return` leaves closure `f2`, but not `f1`, meaning `expression` is still evaluated.

If `return` is used without a value, the typer ensures that the return type of the function is `Void`. If `return` has a value expression, the typer [unifies](3.5-Unification.md) its type with the return type (explicitly given or inferred from previous `return` expressions) of the function it returns from.
