## 2.5.2 Class Notation for Structure Types

When defining a structure type, haxe allows using the same syntax as described in [Class Fields](4-Class_Fields.md). The following [typedef](3.1-Typedef.md) declares a `Point` type with variable fields `x` and `y` of type `Int`:

```haxe
typedef Point = {
    var x : Int;
    var y : Int;
}
```
