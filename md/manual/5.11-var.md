## 5.11 var

Local variables are declared using the **var** keyword
```haxe
var x;
var y = 3;
var w : String = "Hello World!";
```

The [type](2-Types.md) of the variable and the value are both optional.  If no value is given, the variable defaults to [Null](2.2-Nullability.md).  If no type is given, the variable type is of type **Unknown**, but is still strictly typed. It's actual type will later be decided by [type inference](3.6-Type_Inference.md).
