## 8.3.1 Expression Reification

Expression reification is used to create instances of `haxe.macro.Expr` in a convenient way. The Haxe Compiler accepts the usual Haxe syntax and translates it to an expression object. It supports several escaping mechanisms, all of which are triggered by the `$` character:



* **`${}` and `$e{}`:** `Expr -> Expr` This can be used to compose expressions. The expression within the delimiting `{ }` is executed, with its value being used in place.
* **`$a{}`:** `Expr -> Array<Expr>` If used in a place where an `Array<Expr>` is expected (e.g. call arguments, block elements), `$a{}` treats its value as that array. Otherwise it generates an array declaration.
* **`$b{}`:** `Array<Expr> -> Expr` Generates a block expression from the given expression array.
* **`$i{}`:** `String -> Expr` Generates an identifier from the given string.
* **`$p{}`:** `Array<String> -> Expr` Generates a field expression from the given string array.
* **`$v{}`:** `Dynamic -> Expr` Generates an expression depending on the type of its argument. This is only guaranteed to work for [Basic Types](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/2.1-Basic_Types.md) and [Enum Instance](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/2.4-Enum_Instance.md).
