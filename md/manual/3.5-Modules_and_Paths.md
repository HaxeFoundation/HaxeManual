## 3.5 Modules and Paths

> Define: Module
>
> All haxe code is organized in modules, which are addressed using paths. In essence, each .hx file represents a module which may contain several types.


The distinction of a module and its containing type of the same name is blurry by design. In fact, addressing `haxe.ds.StringMap<Int>` can be considered shorthand for `haxe.ds.StringMap.StringMap<Int>`. The latter version consists of four parts:



1. the package `haxe.ds`
2. the module name `StringMap`
3. the type name `StringMap`
4. the type parameter `Int`


If the module and type name are equal, the duplicate can be removed, leading to the `haxe.ds.StringMap<Int>` short version. However, knowing about the extended version helps with understanding how [Module Sub-Types](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/3.5.1-Module_Sub-Types.md) are addressed.

Paths can be shortened further by using an [Import](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/3.5.2-Import.md), which typically allows omitting the package part of a path. This may lead to usage of unqualified identifiers, for which understanding the [Resolution Order](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/3.5.3-Resolution_Order.md) is required.
