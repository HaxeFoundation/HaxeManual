## 3.3.4 Function Return

Unification of function return types may involve the `Void`-type ([Void](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/2.1.3-Void.md)) and require a clear definition of what unifies with `Void`. With `Void` describing the absence of a type, it is not assignable to any other type, not even `Dynamic`. This means that if a function is explicitly declared as returning `Dynamic`, it must not return `Void`.

The opposite applies as well: If a function declares a return type of `Void`, it cannot return `Dynamic` or any other type. However, this direction of unification is allowed when assigning function types:

```
var func:Void->Void = function() return "foo";
```
The right-hand function clearly is of type `Void->String`, yet we can assign it to variable `func` of type `Void->Void`. This is because the compiler can safely assume that the return type is irrelevant, given that it could not be assigned to any non-`Void` type.
