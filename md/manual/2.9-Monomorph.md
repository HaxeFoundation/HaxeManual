## 2.9 Monomorph

A monomorph is a type which may, through [Unification](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/3.3-Unification.md), morph into a different type later. We shall see details about this type when talking about [Type Inference](https://github.com/Simn/HaxeManual/tree/master/md/manual/3.4-Type_Inference.md).
