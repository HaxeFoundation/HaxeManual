## 5.22.2 safe cast

Unlike [unsafe casts](expression-cast-unsafe.md), the runtime behavior in case of a failing cast is defined for safe casts:

```haxe
class Base {
	public function new() { }
}

class Child1 extends Base {}

class Child2 extends Base {}

class Main {
    public static function main() {
		var child1:Base = new Child1();
		var child2:Base = new Child2();
		cast(child1, Base);
		cast(child1, Child2); // Exception: Class cast error
    }
}
```

In this example we first cast a class instance of type `Child1` to `Base`, which succeeds because `Child1` is a [child class](types-class-inheritance.md) of `Base`. We then try to cast the same class instance to `Child2`, which is not allowed because instances of `Child2` are not instances of `Child1`.

The Haxe compiler guarantees that an exception of type `String` is [thrown](expression-throw.md) in this case. This exception can be caught using a [`try/catch` block](expression-try-catch.md).

Safe casts have a runtime overhead. It is important to understand the the compiler already generates type checks, so it is redundant to add manual checks, e.g. using `Std.is`. The intended usage is to try the safe cast and catch the `String` exception.
